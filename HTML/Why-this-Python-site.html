<h1>Why this Python site?</h1>>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>This site is about comparison of systems for technological computations, like, Python, R, and Wolfram Language. Many of the posts are studies embarked on in order to confirm or reject my assumptions / impressions about Python.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beware that I am not enamored by Python. I do not dislike Python, but I dislike many of the attitudes and opinions about its place and usefulness. I do prefer to keep (relatively) objective opinions about research and software developments tools. Hence, I voice opinions that paint Python in negative light.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, in order to be objective, we have to compare same or similar functionalities implemented in the different programming languages (tools) and apply those functionalities to the same problems. This blog is going to show such applications using Python. Related comparisons of mine can be found in:</p>
